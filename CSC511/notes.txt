Week 2:

* identifiers - are the names given to a function, class or variable
              - they are made up of any combination of letters, numbers and the underscore.
              - the following are rules when selecting identifiers:
                    1. first character must be a letter or underscore
                    2. following characters after the first character can consist of letters, digits or the underscore
                    3. can not be a c++ keyword
                    4. maximum number of characters is 1024^5

* a good identifier is one that helps convey what the function does.
* indentifiers represented with in all uppercase letters are usually reserved for (symbolic)constants
* c++ is case sensitive (the compiler distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase characters)
        > eg: TOTAL, Total, total; though they are made up of the same characters or have the same meaning,
              the compiler interprets them as three different variables.

* advantages of using a function in a program: 
        > makes the code clear and easy to understand
        > saves you the hassle of typing the same code multiple times, thus improving productivity
        > individual functions can be easily tested
        > incase there is any modification in the code, you can modify just the function without having to change the 
          entire structure of the program.

int main()
{
    cout << "hello world";

    return 0;
}

* the function header line in this case 'int main()' contains 3 pieces of information:
    > what type of data(if any) is returned from the function
    > name of the function 
    > what type of data (if any) is sent to the function

* argument - data transmitted to the function at runtime.

* {  } - determine the beginning and the end of the function body
