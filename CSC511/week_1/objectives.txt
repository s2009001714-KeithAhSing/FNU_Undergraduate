* Explain computer systems hardware, software and the internet 
    > computer systems: is a complete working computer. this includes the computer along with 
      any software and peripheral devices that are necessary to make the computer function.

    > software: a self-contained set of instructions used to operate a computer to produce a specific 
                result.

    > hardware: these are the physical parts of a computer, such as the monitor, keyboard, sound card,
                motherboard etc

    > internet: also called 'the net' is a worldwide system of computer networks i.e a network of networks 
                in which users at any one computer with the right permissions can get information from any 
                other computer.

* Explain the definition of a program
    > a program is a self-contained set of instructions created to operate a computer 

* Explain a programs design process 
    > there are four steps in the design process:
        step 1: analysis 
            > determine the inputs and output of the program
        step 2: design 
            > here an algorithm is selected or created to solve the problem. the algorithm is 
              continuely refined until the solution is complete and acceptable.
        step 3: coding 
            > coding begins in this step. the algorithm developed in step 2 is written in  
              the desired programming language of choice, containing well-defined patterns and 
              structures such as sequence, selection, iteration and invocation
        step 4: testing 
            > program is tested with extreme values and under certain conditions to verify correctness and 
              to ensure that all the requirements are met.

* Explain problem solving 
    > in the context of computer science, problem solving begins with first understanding how humans solve problems,
      creating/selecting an algorithm to solve the problem, then translating the said algorithm into a language that can 
      be executed by a computer.
    > simply put, using the software development procedure to solve a problem.

* Use various design tools to breakdown problems into manageable programmable bits

* Discuss different ways of writing algorithms 
    > algorithms can be represented by:
        * pseudocode
        * formulae
        * flow charts

* Discuss software development phases and steps(analysis, design, coding and testing)
    There are 3 phases in software development:
        Phase 1: Design and development
            > this phase has 4 steps(detailed explanation above)

        Phase 2: Documentation
            > the following documentation must be included for every problem solution:
                * program description
                * algorithm development and changes
                * well-commented program listings
                * sample test runs 
                * user manuals 

        Phase 3: Maintenance 
            > includes:
                * ongoing correction of newly discovered bugs
                * revisions to meet changing user needs
                * addition of new features 
            > usually the longest phase
            > primary source of revenue
            > to achieve effective maintenance, good documentation is vital
