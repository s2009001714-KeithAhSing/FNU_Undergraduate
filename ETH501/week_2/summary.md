#Devine Command theory:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands, and therefore 
   for man to be moral, he must follow God's commands.

###Euthyphro Dilemma:
* (1) is an action morally good because God commands it or (2) does God command
   it because it is morally good

	- the second alternative threatens the sovereignty of God and suggests that 
    God's moralilty depends on his adherence to this external standard. Therefore 
	if God submits to an external standard, than He is not God.

	* the Euthyphro Dilemma is false because God does not arbitrarily decide what is 
   good or bad on a whim. Doing good is God's nature, and God never acts contrary to 
   His nature.
